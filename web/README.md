# Spotify Clone (Web)

A minimal Spotify-like web app with HTML5 Audio playback, playlists, browse/search pages, and a Tailwind UI. No backend required; state persists to localStorage.

## Run

npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed local URL.

## Features
- HTML5 Audio playback: play, pause, next/prev, seek, volume, mute
- Global player state via React Context
- Browse, Search, Library, Playlist pages
- Local playlists saved to localStorage
- Tailwind CSS UI

## Notes
- Demo MP3s use short public sample audio URLs.
- Replace `src/data/tracks.js` with your own URLs for real tracks.
